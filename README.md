# Lab 8 - Starter
## Q1
### My answer: manually run them locally before pushing code  
Running tests locally is faster for this small Recipe project. We usually use Github actions for larger tests that runs remotely and take longer time to run. Running tests after all development isn't very meaningful because it's really hard to debug the complex whole system if there's ant bug. Testing every small piece of code we write as we proceed is the steady path to successful development of the software.  
## Q2
### My answer: No

## Q3
### My answer: No 
This message feature is a integration of many parts of the code. Unit tests test individual parts of the code.

## Q4
### My answer: Yes 
Limiting the max message length seems to be a funtionality done by a single part of the code. It's not a integrated and complicated feature.
